    "1. Applications: Access to APIs ensures more flexibility in information-transfer processes.\n",

    "2. Reach: APIs let you create layers in apps in order to distribute information to different audiences.\n",

    "3. Customization: Furthermore, it can serve as a solution to create different experiences for users, letting protocols, functions, and commands be adapted according to specific demands.\n",

    "4. Efficiency: When you have content that is automatically published and made available on different channels simultaneously, APIs allow for more efficient data distribution.\n",

    "Web API is an API as the name suggests, it can be accessed over the web using the HTTP protocol. It is a framework that helps you to create and develop HTTP based RESTFUL services. The web API can be developed by using different technologies such as java, ASP.NET, etc. Web API is used in either a web server or a web browser. Basically Web API is a web development concept. It is limited to Web Application’s client-side and also it does not include a web server or web browser details. If an application is to be used on a distributed system and to provide services on different devices like laptops, mobiles, etc then web API services are used. Web API is the enhanced form of the web application.\n",

REST is a software architectural style that defines the set of rules to be used for creating web services. Web services which follow the REST architectural style are known as RESTful web services.

    "The shortcomings of SOAP are:\n",

    "1. Slow: SOAP uses XML format that must be parsed to be read. It defines many standards that must be followed while developing the SOAP applications. So it is slow and consumes more bandwidth and resource.\n",
